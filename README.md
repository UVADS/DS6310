### Grades

Final grades will be computed using the following weighting:

- Attendance (5%)
- Homework (30%)
- [Homework explications](#homework-explications) (15%)
- Midterm exam (20%)
- Final exam (30%)

Grading scale:

- 93-100 A
- 90-92 A-
- 87-89 B+
- 83-86 B
- 80-82 B-
- 77-79 C+
- 73-76 C
- 70-72 C-
- <70 F

*Note that a B- is the lowest satisfactory grade for graduate credit.*

### Course Policies

**Submitting Homework**

Homework will be accepted through the Assignments page on Canvas. Submissions will be in PDF format. You may hand-write and scan problem solutions, or you may use a typesetting software like LaTeX, Markdown, etc. Some homework assignments will involve using code to produce graphical or numerical outputs and will require the use of software. Please compile all materials in a single PDF for submission and make sure that whatever you have written can be clearly read by the grader. 

Grades for (on-time) homework will be made visible to students no later than one week after the assignment due date. Grades for late work (see below) will become available as time permits.

**Late Work Policy**

The expectation in this course is that all assignments will be submitted on time. Submitting your work on time respects the efforts of your instructor and teaching assistant, and it ensures that you are prepared to learn subsequent material.

Assignments turned in after the due date incur a 10% penalty per late day. For example, an assignment due at 9:30 am on Tuesday that is submitted to Canvas at 3:00 pm on Thursday will incur a 30% penalty. If the assignment would have received a 95% had it been returned on time, then the late grade is 65%. Note that weekend days count towards the late penalty.

I will not accept work that is late by more than one week past its due date. 

*To provide flexibility for weeks in which life circumstances do not permit the completion of your coursework, your lowest homework grade will be dropped.*

**Class Attendance**

Attendance in this class is mandatory. If you need to miss a class for any reason, please email me in advance. You are responsible for keeping up with the lecture material, but I am happy to work with you during office hours or by appointment to brush up on things you may have missed.

**Extenuating Circumstances**

Students are expected to communicate with me as soon as possible regarding extenuating circumstances and how their participation in the course, including attendance and assignment submissions, may be affected by them.

### Homework explications

**Definition and goal**

An explication is a detailed explanation. The goal of homework explications is to give students the opportunity to explain, in detail, their reasoning as they work towards the solution of a homework problem. Explications are intended to encourage real-time logical thinking and argument based upon the principles learned in class and in readings.

**How will explications be implemented?**

For each homework that is assigned, two students will be asked to give an explication. Explications will take place during the class period coinciding with the assignment due date (typically this will be a Thursday). Specifically,

1. At the start of class time, the instructor will choose a homework problem from the week's assignment and ask one of the students to present their solution to the problem to the class on the whiteboard (if an element of the solution involves a simulation, the student may use a laptop as well).

2. A Q&A / discussion will follow, in which members of the class and/or the instructor may ask clarifying questions of the presenting student. Subjects of relevance to lecture material will be elucidated.

3. Steps 1. and 2. will be repeated for the second student, but a different problem will be chosen.
The two explications combined should take around 25-30 minutes of class time.

**How will explications be graded?**

Your grade will be determined by the instructor based on a combination of

1. The quality of your solution.
2. The clarity of your reasoning.
3. Your ability to justify your solution choices based on things we have learned in class and in readings.

Note that the *correctness* of your solution is not a criterion. Yes, correct solutions may tend to be higher quality, but an incorrect solution could still be high quality if the steps taken along the way are coherent and generally sensible.

 
**Additional notes for explicators**

- You may use your notes (i.e. your homework solutions) as you write and explain your solution. However, *please do not treat this as an exercise in rote memorization*. You need to understand your solutions in order to answer questions about them.
- You should be prepared to explain your solution to any of the homework problems from the current week's assignment. You will not know in advance which solution you will be asked to explain.
